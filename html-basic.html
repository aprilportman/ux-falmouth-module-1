<p style="color:white">After creating an account with GitHub, I had to revert back to Giovanni's tutorial to ensure I was utilising the features correctly. The account is easy to use, and it is simple to comprehend.</p>
	<p style="color:white">After making chnages to the local file, it took me a while to figuer out how to see the updated version. After I located it, I was able to push the commit.&nbsp;</p>
	<p style="color:white">Github is an effective tool for developpers which enable them to make chnages to an artefact that allows them to control the version they wish to keep. Reflecting on previous projects, this tool would have been helpful for me to continue developping an artefact without having to save multiple files locally. Moving forwards, I intend to utilise Github to proceed with project changes and allow myself control over the version I intent to keep.</p>
